# oscillatory_neurocomputers
Code for the project of the Seminar in Differential Equations and Modeling. Master's degree in Mathematics from Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya.
In this project, I studied the work from the paper: 
Frank C. Hoppensteadt and Eugene M. Izhikevich. Oscillatory neurocomputers with dynamic connectivity. Physical Review Letters, 82(14):2983–2986, apr 1999.
